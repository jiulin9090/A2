      <h1>Best of British Car Manufacturing</h1>
      <p>
        Many people believe that the British car industry belongs to the past. Compared with countries
        like Germany or Japan, Britain is sometimes seen as having lost its manufacturing strength.
        However, this view misses an important reality. Today, the UK remains one of the most productive
        and influential centres of car manufacturing in the world. From large-scale factories and
        global exports to engines, luxury vehicles, and racing technology, British automotive production
        continues to play a vital role on the global stage.

        <h2>A Common Misunderstanding</h2>
        <p>
          The idea that Britain no longer has a strong car industry is a common misunderstanding.
          While some historic brands and factories have disappeared, the industry itself has not
          declined. Instead, it has changed. Britain now focuses on high-quality production,
          advanced engineering, and global collaboration rather than simply producing cars for
          its domestic market.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="factories">
        <h2>Factories Across Britain</h2>
        <p>
          Modern car manufacturing can be found all across the UK. In Swindon, Honda employs around
          2,700 people to build popular models such as the Civic, Jazz, and CR-V. These cars are made
          using efficient production systems and are sold to customers around the world.
        </p>

          </div>
        </div>

        <p>
          Toyota also produces cars in Derbyshire, and many of these vehicles are exported back to
          Japan. This shows how highly British manufacturing standards are valued internationally.
          In the north-east of England, Nissan operates one of the most productive car factories in
          Europe, producing more vehicles than the entire Italian motor industry combined.
        </p>

      <section id="engines">
        <h2>Powering the World</h2>
        <p>
          Britain’s importance goes beyond assembling cars. It is also a global leader in engine
          manufacturing. One in every three Ford vehicles sold worldwide contains an engine made in
          Wales or Essex.
        </p>
        <p>
          These engines are shipped internationally and power millions of cars every day. Even when
          drivers never see the words “Made in Britain,” they may still rely on British engineering
          whenever they turn the key.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="luxury">
        <h2>Luxury and Craftsmanship</h2>
        <p>
          British car manufacturing is world-famous for luxury. At the Rolls-Royce plant in Sussex,
          vehicles are assembled by hand with extreme attention to detail. Britain is the only country
          that insists on using leather from bulls to trim its car seats, as it produces fewer
          imperfections.
        </p>

        <div class="image-block">

          </div>
        </div>

        <p>
          Each Rolls-Royce receives around 45 kilograms of paint, applied in many layers to create a
          flawless finish. This level of care shows how Britain competes not through low costs, but
          through quality and craftsmanship.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="racing">
        <h2>The Global Racing Hub</h2>
        <p>
          Britain is also the heart of global motorsport. Out of the eleven Formula One teams in the
          world, eight are based in the UK, and seven can even be seen from the top of a single hill
          in Oxfordshire.
        </p>
        <p>
          British engineering supports racing far beyond Formula One. Every IndyCar race, every Dakar
          Rally winner since 2009, and many high-performance vehicles use gearboxes made in a small
          industrial estate in Berkshire. This shows how Britain quietly supports motorsport success
          worldwide.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="summary">
        <h2>Why Britain Still Matters</h2>
        <p>
          Far from being a declining industry, British car manufacturing remains highly influential.
          Through advanced factories, global exports, luxury craftsmanship, and racing technology,
          the UK continues to shape how cars are built and used around the world. The British car
          industry may be underestimated, but it is far from outdated.
